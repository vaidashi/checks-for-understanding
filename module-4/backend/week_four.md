## Week Four - Module 4 Recap

Fork this respository. Answer the questions to the best of your ability. Try to answer them with limited amount of external research. These questions cover the majority of what we've learned this week. 

Note: When you're done, submit a PR. 

1. What's your favorite project management tool?
Waffle, although for a project with in depth user stories, I can see the value of using Pivotal Tracker over Waffle.

2. Why do we create staging environments?
In order to mitigate problems arising from deploying changes/new features immediately into your production environment that could cause unintended problems for your application.

3. What are the characteristics of a good README (in your opinion)?
Step by step description and list of commands to run in order to set up repo/environment correctly. Pictures/screenshots if possible. List of API endpoints (if applicable).

4. What's one main improvement you're going to make to your code regarding accessibility issues?
Color scheme choices for those who have cases of color blindness. Not having too much text and choosing appropriate font to aid those with reading disabilities.

5. What are some basic security concerns to be aware of when building applications?
Storing sensitive information without encryption and/or with outdated or poor security management procedures. Accounting for both internal and external gaps in security. 

6. Why is continuous integration helpful/important?
To ensure your latest changes do not break the integrity of your application by receiving advance notice prior to a merge.

7. What are some continuous integration tools?
Travis CI, Circle, Jenkins.

#### Review  

8. What are some characteristics of "good" git workflow?
Checkout of a new branch from master branch. Focusing on one feature for checked out branch and later PR. Tagging individuals for review of your code prior to merge into master branch. 

9. What are the four fundamental concepts of object oriented programming?
Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism.

10. What's a module in Ruby and what's the difference between a class and a module?
You don't instantiate a module, whereas you would for a class object. A module allows you to encapsulate code/functions that could be used across different classes thereby giving you better DRY code.
